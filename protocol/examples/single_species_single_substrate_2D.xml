				Each <boundaryCondition> also includes a <shape> mark-up to define the shape of the boundary.

				The possible boundary types and any particular parameters that need to be given are:

					(no parameters)
				- BoundaryBulk: a boundary connected to a <bulk> region, with a spatial region within
					the domain representing the entire compartment. If agents cross this boundary
					they are treated as having left the computation domain. Other parameters include:
					* 'activeForSolute': set to 'yes' to allow solutes to interact with the bulk
						<param name="activeForSolute">yes</param>
					* 'bulk': this specifies wich <bulk> compartment to connect to.
						<param name="bulk">MyTank</param>
				- BoundaryCyclic: the boundary is periodic with another boundary, so that agents leaving
					this boundary will enter through the other, and vice-versa; solute concentrations
					are constant across the two boundaries. You must specify the two faces (<shape>)
					that are to be connected this way.
				- BoundaryGasMembrane: a boundary that is impermeable to agents and most solutes, but
					permeable to a specified solute (used to represent gas transfer membranes).
					Parameters include:
					* You must specify a bulk compartment and the solute able to permeate:

		REACTION SECTION
	######################################################################-->

	<!-- In this next section all the reactions included in the simulation should be defined.
		The <reaction> mark-up defines which type of biomass carries out the reaction. The
		parameter for 'catalyzedBy' should be 'biomass', 'inert', or 'capsule'), and the 'name'
		parameter should be unique to this reaction. The class should be kept as 'ReactionFactor'.

		Then each reaction has a 'muMax' parameter, which is the maximum rate at which the reaction
		may proceed.

		Next are one or more <kineticFactor> mark-ups that define multiplicative factors affecting
		the reaction rate and decreasing the overall rate from muMax to something lower. There are
		several possible types for <kineticFactor>, and each may take a parameter as well as a
		solute that will set the term's value:
			* Monod kinetic: S/(Ks+S)
				<kineticFactor class="MonodKinetic" solute="MyNH4">
					<param name="Ks" unit="g.L-1">1.5e-3</param>
				</kineticFactor>

			* Simple inhibition kinetic: Ki/(Ki+S)
				<kineticFactor class="SimpleInhibition" solute="o2d">
					<param name="Ki" unit="g.L-1">1.5e-3</param>
				</kineticFactor>

			* Haldane kinetic: S/(Ks + S + S^2/Ki)
				<kineticFactor class="HaldaneKinetic" solute="MyNO3">
					<param name="Ks" unit="g.L-1">0.05e-3</param>
					<param name="Ki" unit="g.L-1">0.25e-3</param>
				</kineticFactor>

			* Hill kinetic: S^h/(Ks^h + S^h)
				<kineticFactor class="HillKinetic" solute="MyCOD">
					<param name="Ks" unit="g.L-1">0.05e-3</param>
					<param name="h" unit="-">0.5</param>
				</kineticFactor>
			
			* First-order kinetic: always gives value 1, for nonvarying rates
				<kineticFactor class="FirstOrderKinetic"/>


		After specifying the reaction kinetic factors, you must specify the coefficients
		of solute and biomass production and consumption; these are in the <yield> mark-up.
		The affected solutes and biomass are each listed with a coefficient, and positive
		values indicate production while negative values indicate consumption. A line such as:
			<param name="MyCOD" unit="g.g-1">-1.5</param>
		specifies the consumption of 'MyNH4' during the reaction on a gram-per-gram basis
		with the catalyzing ('catalyzedBy') biomass type. In the above line, production of
		a total of one gram of biomass will consume 1.5 grams of 'MyCOD'.

		SPECIES SECTION
	######################################################################-->

	<!-- The final part of the protocol file is used to define the species involved
		in the current simulation using <species> mark-ups. Each species is defined
		from one of several different classes, and each is given a name and
		has some defining parameters. These are described in detail here.
		
		Following the opening mark-up is the list of <particle> types that make up this
		species; bacteria species will generally have biomass, inert, and
		capsule <particle>s, while EPS will have only capsule. You may specify the
		initial mass of the compartment, or set it to 0 to allow a random value.  

		Now we show the parameters that are common to most species:
		* the color is used to distinguish agents in POV-Ray output images
			<param name="color">yellow</param>
		* you must define which domain the agents will live in
			<param name="computationDomain">MyBiofilm</param>
		* you must specify how large the agents may be before dividing; the actual
			division decision will be based on a standard deviation around this value
			<param name="divRadius" unit="um">2</param>
		* you must specify the size below which the agent is removed from the simulation
			<param name="deathRadius" unit="um">0.1</param>
		* the 'shoveFactor' parameter controls how much overlap there is for agents of
			this species; =1 is touching, <1 is overlap, and >1 provides space around
			the agent
			<param name="shoveFactor" unit="um">1</param>
		* the 'shoveLimit' parameter sets the overlap allowed before shoving occurs,
			and is usally kept at 0
			<param name="shoveLimit" unit="um">0.</param>

		Next come the parameters unique to a species, and we explain those below.

		After the unique parameters comes a list of reactions that this species is
		involved with, using the <reaction> mark-ups. If the 'status' is set to 'inactive',
		then the reaction will not be carried out by the species for this simulation.

		Finally, you need to declare parameters on how each species begins life in the simulaton.
		This will depend on whether you are using traditional one-time attachment or the new self-attachment
		scenario. You set this in the ATTACHMENT tag in the SIMULATOR section

		FOR ONETIME ATTACHMENT (AS IN TRADITIONAL VERSIONS OF IDYNOMICS):
		The <initArea> mark-up defines the rectangular region within which
		the given number of individuals of this species should be placed; the agents
		will be placed randomly in this region. The coordinates should be given in spatial
		(micron) units, not element # (unitless). The 'birthday' parameter sets when
		in the simulation the agents should be introduced. You may define any number
		of <initArea> regions, and if <initArea> is omitted, no agents will be created
		automatically.

		FOR SELF-ATTACHMENT SCENARIOS (NEW TO IDYNOMICS VERSION 1.2):
		- Specify the hour that cell injection begins in parameter "cellInjectionStartHour" - this can be set to 0 if from the start of the simulation
		- Specify the cell attachment frequency during injection (per hour) in parameter "injectionOnAttachmentFrequency" - i.e. number of cells that 
			attach to the substratum or biofilm per hour when injection on
		- Specify the hour at which cell injection stops, in parameter "cellInjectionEndHour". No more cells will be introduced in the simulation from that point
		- Specify the cell attachment frequency during injection (per hour) in parameter "injectionOffAttachmentFrequency" - i.e. number of cells that 
			attach to the substratum or biofilm per hour when injection off


		POSSIBLE SPECIES TYPES:

		ParticulateEPS: this represents generic extracellular polymers and contains only
			the 'capsule' <particle> type. This <species> has no unique parameters.

		Bacterium: this is a generic bacteria species that is generally composed of
			biomass, inert, and capsule compartments. If the <particle> type 'capsule' is
			included, you must specify the type of EPS that will be excreted using the
			'class' parameter; the argument should be one of the EPS <species> you have
			PREVIOUSLY defined in the mark-up. (If you use a <species> here that appears
			later in the protocol file, an error will results.)
		
			The unique parameter you may define is 'epsMax', which sets the maximum
			fraction (by volume) of the agent that may be taken up by EPS:
			<param name="epsMax">0.1</param>

		BactEPS: this <species> is the same as Bacterium, but with the additional
			functionality of a first-order hydrolysis of bound EPS in the 'capsule' compartment.
			You may specify the hydrolysis rate:
			<param name="kHyd" unit="hr-1">0.007</param>

		BactAdaptable: this <species> derives from BactEPS, but adds the ability to turn
			reactions on or off depending on different conditions. After specifying ALL
			reactions that this species may carry out in the <reaction> mark-ups, the
			<reactionSwitch> mark-up defines when those reactions will be utilized. The
			mark-up is shown here and explained below:
