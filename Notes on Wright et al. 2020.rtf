\f0\b\fs22 \cf0 Notes on replicating the results of Wright, Clegg, Coker & Kreft (2020) \'93Damage repair versus aging in biofilms using an individual-based model\'94 - preprint at \ul https://tinyurl.com/twnk895\
\
\ulnone We used iDynoMiCS version 1.5 (\ul https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/generic/idynomics/index.aspx\ulnone ), written in Java, for all simulations, and all analysis scripts were written in Python.\
\pard\pardeftab720\ri0\partightenfactor0
\cf0 The full data for all simulations shown in this manuscript are over 2 TB. We have therefore not provided these data, but have provided protocol files for each type of simulation run in this study:\

Below, we describe the files that we have used here, the main sections that these fall into and how the example protocol files may be edited to reproduce these. All toolbox_ files in the results analysis folder are modified from our previous study, Clegg et al. (2014).\

\f3\b0 \cf0 \ulnone  (where damage accumulation rate, 0.22, is proportional to specific growth rate, which has a maximum of 0.6 h\super -1\nosupersub )\
	
\f0\b - Aims of simulations:\
		
\f3\b0 - Compare the new adaptive repair mechanism with the fixed, optimal repair used by Clegg et al. (2014)\
		- Examine the effect of the new adaptive repair mechanism on the growth rates and investment into repair for all six possible repair/division strategies (listed in Figure 1) when growing on their own in the constant environment with no competition (i.e. only one cell is left in the simulation domain).\
		- Look at the growth rate distributions for cells of a single strategy at day 100 of simulated growth.\
	
\f0\b - Manuscript:
\f3\b0 \
		- Figure 2: Characteristics of strategies in a constant environment (no competition) showing: (A) investment into repair for the new \
		  adaptive strategy following the old pole cell over many divisions; (B) Specific growth rate of a single cell over consecutive cell divisions \
		  over a 24 h period; and (C) distribution of specific growth rates in populations at steady state (100 days). \
		- Figure S1: The investment into repair 
\f4\i versus
\f3\i0  the proportion of protein that has been invested into repair for symmetrically and \
		  asymmetrically dividing cells of the adaptive repair strategy.\
		- Figure S2: Computational replicates of Figure 2. \
		- Figure S3: Age and size distributions (scatter plot) for computational replicates of all six strategies at steady state. \
