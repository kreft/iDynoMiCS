/**
 * \brief Performs an update to the iDynomics tool if a new version has been detected
 * 
 * This class should be thought of as a standalone class. It may be packaged within iDynomics, and called by iDynomics, but is run 
 * independently as its own jar file. The purpose of this is to download the latest version from the web repository, extract the files, 
 * update the currently downloaded version to the new version, and then delete files used in the update. As this is changing class files, 
 * one of which could be the main simulator, the simulation should be shut down when this is done. Therefore, iDynomics calls this jar and 
 * exits - the update can be performed, and the user should then restart iDynomics.
 * 
 * This code has been amended from a freely available example update procedure written by Thomas Otero, documented here:
 * http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/190944-creating-an-updater-in-java/ 
 * 
 * @author Thomas Otero - Created the original code and made this available online. This has been modified from his code.
 * @author Kieran Alden - Altered this code to fit iDynomics specifically and added the required documentation to suit doxygen output
