 * \brief BoundaryCyclic : close the system along a dimension
 * 
 * BoundaryCyclic : close the system along a dimension. It is computationally unfeasible to simulate a micro-scale world on a 
 * macro-scale level, so oftentimes a small spatial sub-region is assumed to represent the system as a whole; in this case, 
 * periodic boundaries are used to remove artificial edge effects by assuming the simulated region adjoins other, similar, regions. 
 * As a consequence, boundaries in some chosen directions (generally for movements parallel to the substratum) are periodic, which 
 * means that the solute concentrations and solute gradients are constant across the boundary, and that agents travelling through one 
 * boundary will be translated to the other side of the domain
