/**
 * \brief Creates an object of the Bacterium EPS Species: a bacterium with a permanent hydrolytic activity of its EPS capsule
 * 
 * The BactEPS species behaves just like the Bacterium species, with one small change: capsular EPS is excreted continuously at a 
 * defined rate rather than during discrete events like for a Bacterium. During excretion, an agent will distribute any excreted EPS 
 * to neighbouring EPS agents of that type, or will create a new EPS agent if none are nearby. This new functionality requires 
 * specification of one additional parameter: the hydrolysis rate kHyd, which controls the rate at which capsular EPS is excreted to 
 * neighboring EPS particles.
