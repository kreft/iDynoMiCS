 * \brief Model a reaction using a monod kinetic factor.
 * 
 * From Wikipedia: The Monod equation is a mathematical model for the growth of
 * microorganisms. It is named for Jacques Monod who proposed using an equation
 * of this form to relate microbial growth rates in an aqueous environment to
 * the concentration of a limiting nutrient. The Monod equation has the same
 * form as the Michaelis-Menten equation, but differs in that it is empirical
 * while the latter is based on theoretical considerations.
