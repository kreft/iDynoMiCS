	 * \brief Processes the files and directories selected from the dialog box when iDynoMiCS is run in Eclipse
	 * 
	 * When iDynoMiCS is run, the user has to specify protocol files. This is done either via a dialog box in Eclipse, or from the 
	 * command line if run from RunIDyno.py. This method takes the files and directories that have been specified either way and processes these, 
	 * adding the relevant files to a linked list. There are a few considerations here (a) If only one file is selected, the method 
	 * checks this is the correct file type (specified by input argument filter) and if so adds this to the list. (b) If the selection 
	 * is a directory, the whole directory is added to the list, again after a pre-check that the files are of the correct file format
	 * 
	 * @param aDirectory	The file(s) or directory selected from the dialog box or specified on the command line for processing
	 * @param filter	The file format of the protocol files (basically the filter to apply to these files)
	 * @param fileList	The linked list that the protocol files should be added to

	/**
	 * \mainpage iDynoMiCS Version 1.2 Code Reference Manual
	 * 
	 * The iDynoMiCS software simulates the growth of microbial communities. iDynoMiCS is written in Java, and uses XML files for input 
	 * and output. Input files allow the users to specify conditions, microbial species, and other parameters without the need to 
	 * become a programmer. Also the positions and other variables of all individual microbes can be specified in another input file. 
	 * This allows one to easily specify many different types of simulations. iDynoMiCS writes plain-text XML files as output, and these 
	 * may be processed using any number of software tools (though we provide some general post-processing routines that run in Matlab 
	 * and are working on R scripts). In addition to XML files, iDynoMiCS also writes scene description input files for POV-Ray, a 
	 * virtual photography software which is used to render 3-D images of the simulated communities.
	 *
	 * iDynoMiCS is under constant development by several different teams working in the realm of microbial ecology. If you are 
	 * interested in contributing to the further development of this software, whether this be through the addition of new 
	 * functionality, new routines for post-processing simulations, or additional PDE solvers or other numerical algorithms, 
	 * please read the information in our <a href="http://www.github.com/kreft">Github repository wiki</a>
	 *
	 * iDynoMiCS has been a collaborative effort between an increasing number of people: Laurent Lardon, Brian Merkey, Joao Xavier, 
	 * Andreas Dötsch, Barth F Smets, Cristian Picioreanu, Rob Clegg, Sonia Martins, Katrin Bohl, Kieran Alden, Jan-Ulrich Kreft 
	 * and others.

	 *  \section getiDyno Getting iDynoMiCS
	 *   
	 * The tool can be downloaded in two different ways. Should you wish to use the tool to perform experimentation, then download 
	 * the Latest Stable release <a href="http://www.biosciences-labs.bham.ac.uk/kreftlab"> here </a>. If however you wish to contribute to the 
	 * future development of the tool (which we encourage), you can download the most up to date version of the source code from our 
	 * <a href="http://www.github.com/kreft">Github repository</a>. Full documentation that details how to contribute to iDynoMiCS development using 
	 * this repository is available on the iDynoMiCS wiki, also located in the Github repository. 
	 *   
	 *   <br>
	 * \section iDynoMail Join the iDynoMiCS Mailing List
	 * 
	 * While we make the code available under a GNU GPL type open source licence called CeCILL, we kindly request that you join the iDynoMiCS mailing 
	 * lists when you download the code. This will help us find out how many scientists are using iDynoMiCS, which we will use to 
	 * support future grant applications to further develop the code, which in turn is in your interest. We will also use the email 
	 * lists to send updates concerning the ongoing development of iDynoMiCS. <a href="http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/generic/idynomics/mailing-list.aspx">Click here for information on joining these lists</a> 
	 *   
	 * <br>  
	 * \section idyno Help with Using iDynoMiCS
	 * 
	 * The best place to start with iDynoMiCS is to complete the tutorial. This can be found in our  <a href="http://www.github.com/kreft">Github repository</a> 
	 * and a PDF can be found in the 'Tutorial' folder in the iDynoMiCS download.
	 * 
	 * Should there be any issues with using iDynoMiCS, you can seek support in two ways. 
	 * 
	 * The first of these is to ask your question via the <a href="https://github.com/kreft/iDynoMiCS/issues">Issue tracking system</a> 
	 * on our <a href="http://www.github.com/kreft">GitHub repository</a>.  There is more information on how to use the Issue tracking 
	 * system in our wiki part of the GitHub repository. 
	 * 
	 * Secondly, you may send questions to the developers via the mailing list idynomics@lists.bham.ac.uk. The developers will aim to 
	 * respond via email as swiftly as time allows. Your query will also be logged as an Issue in our GitHub repository with the 
	 * appropriate reply, in order that this remains available for other users who may have the same question. 
	 *
